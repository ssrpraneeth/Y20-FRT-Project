Key Features of Azure Static Web Apps:

1.	Web hosting for static content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images are all supported, providing a robust platform for the learning assistant's interface.
2.	Integrated API support: Azure Functions seamlessly integrate with Static Web Apps, enabling additional functionality and data retrieval.
3.	GitHub and Azure DevOps integration: Changes to the repository trigger automated builds and deployments, streamlining the development process.
4.	Global distribution: Content is distributed globally, ensuring optimal performance for users worldwide.
5.	Free SSL certificates: SSL certificates are automatically provided and renewed, prioritizing security for users interacting with the learning assistant.
6.	Custom domains: Custom domains can be easily configured, allowing for branded customization of the assistant's interface and enhancing its professional appearance.

With these services and features, the Ed-Tech Learning Assistant project aims to provide users with an intuitive and informative experience, offering insights and recommendations to enhance their educational journey and access to learning resources.
